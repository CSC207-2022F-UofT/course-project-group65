# Tournament Bracket Manager
### Principally, this program has two uses: 
1.  __A user may create a new tournament__; this user has the responsibility of running
    the tournament. Once they have created and launched the tournament, they may invite other
    players/teams to the tournament, assign them different roles with varying access and
    privileges. This user running the tournament can assign points to each match and run the
    tournament and advance the rounds at their convenience. Once the user wishes to conclude
    the tournament, they may choose to do so.


2. __A user may wish to join a pre-existing tournament via an invite link__ from the creator of the
tournament - and the invite link establishes their access level to the bracket and their privileges
in tournament. Should they join in a playing capacity, they can join a team in the tournament or
create their own and advance through the tournament. If they join in an officiating role, they
help run the tournament by advancing rounds of the tournament and dealing with updates to
the game.

## Running the Project
To run the program, do not use Main.java. Run the program through the TournamentSimulator.java file. As well, please make sure to change the build settings from Gradle to IntelliJ IDEA to use the program. This piazza post details how we do it: https://piazza.com/class/l5v1b8gfz6b60m/post/473


Go to file -> settings -> build, execution, development -> build tools -> gradle. Change the build and run to IntelliJ Idea like so:
